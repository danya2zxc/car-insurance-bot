# Car Insurance Bot

## Description

A Telegram bot that helps users buy car insurance by processing document photos and using AI-powered communication.

> ðŸš§ **Core workflow implemented.** The bot handles the full document processing and confirmation flow via Mindee API. Next steps: OpenAI integration, testing, and deployment.

## Features

- **FSM-based Workflow:** A clear, stateful conversation flow from start to finish.
- **Passport & Vehicle Document Upload:** Securely handles user photo submissions.
- **Mindee API Integration:** Extracts data from documents in real-time.
- **Interactive Confirmation:** Allows users to confirm data or request changes at each step.
- **Dynamic Keyboards:** User-friendly inline buttons for all interactions.
- **Basic Error Handling:** Gracefully handles invalid photos and API errors.
